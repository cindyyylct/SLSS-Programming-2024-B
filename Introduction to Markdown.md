**Hello** _world_.

This is **markdown**

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) is a really useful tool. I also use [Google](https://www.google.com) to find things.

# Table in Markdown

## This is a level two header

Name          | Age         | Coolness      | Superpower
---           | ---         | ---           | ---
Batman        | probably 30 | VERY          | rich/smart
Mr.Ubial      | pretty old  | his kids think he's cool | he can nap anywhere

To make a list we use the following: 

* this is the first item in the list
* this is the second
    * this is actually a subpoint in this list

- this is also a list
- you can use these as bulletes as well
    - you can also use sublists with dashes


1. this is the first item in an ordered list
3. this is the second
    1. this is a sublist
    2. another item
        - this is unordered
        - same here

# Blockquote

these are usually used to show quotes, things people have said.
